The RFID locker is a security tool that can be used for doors and drawers, ensuring security through encoded cards, using a chip proximity instead of metal keys.
 This project consists of an RFID lock with an Arduino Nano programmed in the Arduino IDE to control access to the robotics team's equipment.
